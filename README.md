# Flutter101
Flutter101

Mobile developers should pay much attention to flutter in 2019, well, this Project is for Flutter learning from zero. Every commit is base on milestone which means it can run exactly. so if you are also intersted in Flutter, you can download and review this easy code based on commits.

I will commit code continuously, but learning guide such as README cannot be promised.

My hobbies:

 - when I name a class name or class file name, I perfer Pascal Case, you can call it Upper Camel Case, rather than Under Score Case.
